# Document Unwarp and Enhancement

This project provides a solution for unwarping and enhancing warped documents, such as scanned images or photos of documents. It uses the **DocuWarp** library for unwarping based on the UVDoc model and includes additional image processing steps for noise reduction and sharpening to improve image quality.

## Features
- **Unwarping**: Automatically corrects warped document images.
- **Noise Reduction**: Reduces noise to clean up the image.
- **Image Sharpening**: Enhances the sharpness of the output for better clarity.
- **Adaptive Processing**: Dynamically adjusts noise reduction and sharpening based on image characteristics.
